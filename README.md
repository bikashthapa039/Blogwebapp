# Blogwebapp
A Blog Web App with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and Authentication features enables users to manage blog posts while ensuring secure access. Users can register or log in to create personalized accounts. Once authenticated, they can add new posts, view existing content, edit their own posts, and delete them as needed. The app typically includes role-based access control, ensuring only authorized users can perform certain actions. This streamlined functionality is ideal for managing and sharing content securely and efficiently.
